Welcome to my github repository!ðŸ‘‹

Currently, I'm practicing endoscopy as an endoscopist at a healthcare center in South Korea.

As a hobby, I have been coding private projects with Ruby on Rails since 2011.

Recently, as a second job, I'm trying small projects in small software development company.
